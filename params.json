{"name":"Disappearing Eclipse Project","body":"I noticed a \"problem\" with using Git and Eclipse workspaces.\r\nhttp://twitter.com/IQAndreas/status/52053104027385856\r\n\r\nIf you don't include the hidden project files (`.project`, `.settings` etc) with the commit, switching to another branch will cause the project to \"implode\"; as the required project files disappear, Eclipse realizes this is no longer a valid project and closes it.\r\n\r\n### Instructions\r\n* Using the command line, checkout the project starting on the `branch` branch (make sure the `.project` and `.settings` files are still there)\r\n* Switch to the `master` branch from inside of Eclipse (I used EGit). The project should close when the `.project` and `.settings` disappear.","tagline":"An example of what happens if you don't include Eclipse's project files with your commits","google":"UA-15151414-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
